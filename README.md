# photoBoot
Call a PHP web service to refresh a full-screen picture based on the file in an image folder
It used a downloaded version of jquery-3.2.1.js and needed a PHP server to be started (WAMP)

# Use case
When software is making photos it saves them in a specific folder (img) then we have to display each of them ^^
- All the pictures are display in full screen mode, and they change every 10sec (user can set the preference duration)
- When the application start, the user can choose the image folder

# TECH NOTE
fadIn and fadOut are set with 2000 milliseconds
